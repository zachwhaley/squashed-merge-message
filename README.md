# <img src="squash.svg" width="32" height="32"> Squashed Merge Message

Use Pull Request description as Squashed and Merged commit messages.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Support for Squashed Merge Message has ended** ‚ÄºÔ∏è

**GitHub has native support for controlling the default merge message** üéâ

See the GitHub [announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-new-options-for-controlling-the-default-commit-message-when-merging-a-pull-request/) for details.

And the GitHub Enterprise [3.7 release notes](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/release-notes#repositories)

I recommend all GitHub patrons use GitHub's [default merge message](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests) feature instead of this web extension to both take advantage of native feature support and avoid any compatibility issues between this web extension and GitHub's implementation.

Thank you all for your support and contributions! üíô
